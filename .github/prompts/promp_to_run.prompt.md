2. If there are no files, the application should log a message and exit gracefully.
3. Generate a Prompt template good enough to set the contexts of what the model is going to summarize, to understand the topic that the highlights are related, identify patterns, conclusions and practical recommendations to make the best of the books highlights done by the reader.
4. Once the resume is returned, a new file must be created inside ./processed_files_output/books_summaries.
