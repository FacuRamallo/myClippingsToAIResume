## Generate Per-Book Markdown Files

**As a** user

**I want** individual markdown files created for each book

**So that** I can review highlights from specific books easily

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Create one `.md` file per book
- Include book metadata (title, author)
- Format highlights with location information
- Use consistent markdown formatting
